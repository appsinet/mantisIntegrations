# mantis-integrations
Several tools and classes to integrate and work with Mantis Bug Tracker. This project is **very experimental**, so don't rely much on it.

To be done:
- [ ] Classes and functions to make calls to Mantisconnect ([Mantisbt SOAP API]( https://www.mantisbt.org/manual/admin.config.soap.html))
- [ ] Function to export Mantis issues to several formats (xml, csv, ..)

I'm planning to develop a Mantis plugin that will have:
- [ ] Option to convert Mantis issues to Phabricator tasks
- [ ] Process to synchronize Mantis issues and Phabricator tasks
